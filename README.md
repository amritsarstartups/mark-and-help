# mark-and-help
Mark And Help app
DESCRIPTION :
===============
A platform to help reduce the starvation by connecting the people_in_need of food with the potential helpers.
People_in_need_of_food can be the ones living in slums, orphanage and old age shelter homes.
Potenial helpers can be the ones with extra food which otherwise going to be wasted like owners of marriage palaces , hostel mess etc.

Starvation ,and not the sin , is the parent of modern crime.
Let's contribute in making this world a better place to live in.
Let's not let the starvation win !!!

USER STORIES :
=============
IN NEED OF HELP :

 This set of users can get their location added on the app by clicking on the MARK A SPOT button.
Afterwards , after filling the form on the marked location , and clicking the save button , the location will be saved.

POTENTIAL HELPER :

This set of users are the ones who can provide the extra food available with them to those in need of it.
By clicking the LET'S HELP button , a map with marked locations will be displayed , from where nearby location can be chosen
for help , and path of reach can be traced by entering the source address. That will fetch him/her the directions to reach the destination of helper.

PRIORITIES :
===================
1) MARK A SPOT button : to let the needy mark their location on the map.
2) LET'S HELP button : This will provide markers to the location where help is required. The directions from the source address of the helper will
also be provided.
3) VOLUNTEER TO CONNECT : The people interested in becoming the link between those in need of help and the potential helpers can act as volunteers to pick the
food from helpers and deliver it to needy. ( will be considered in future extension , not included here)
4) The time during which help can be provided will also be added . there will be two kind of people_in_need -
a) in temporary help need
b) in permanent help need like orphanages,old age homes
For both we are going to have different kind of approach. The mark for first one gonna disappear after the mentioned time while the mark for latter one will be of permanent type
